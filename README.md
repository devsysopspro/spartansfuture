The API is working now. I've temporarily attached my domain to resolve the SSL issue: It will save the data on ec2 server in mongodb.

The frontend app is also working and successfully sending requests to the backend:

There were several issues in the app which Iâ€™ve fixed. Signup is currently working, but login is showing a roles related error that you'll need to check.
